/**
 * Scripted chatbot storyboards — the "showtime" flows Obe asked for: pick a use
 * case and the AI walks the request from start to finish with mock data.
 *
 * Text may contain tokens resolved at render time against the selected account:
 *   {name}          customer name
 *   {account}       account number (chatbot context)
 *   {address}       service address
 *   {source}        active data source label (C2M (live) / Autonomous DB)
 *   {sourceSystem}  full system name of the active data source
 *
 * The {source} tokens are what make the internal C2M/Autonomous toggle visible
 * in the conversation itself.
 *
 * `think` (optional on ai/status/summary steps): a list of short status phrases
 * shown one-by-one with a shimmering "working" animation just before the step
 * appears — e.g. ["Analysing your request", "Reading usage history"]. When
 * omitted, a sensible default sequence is generated automatically.
